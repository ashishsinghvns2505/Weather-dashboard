1️⃣ Weather Dashboard

Real-Time Weather and Air Quality Dashboard Using Power BI and WeatherAPI. n this project, I built a real-time weather dashboard using Power BI by connecting it with live data from WeatherAPI.
This project showcases a real-time weather dashboard built using Power BI and WeatherAPI. It connects to live weather and air quality data and visualizes it through interactive visuals.

2️⃣ Purpose
The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to:

Build a real-time, interactive dashboard in Power BI

Integrate live data using WeatherAPI

Visualize both current weather conditions and air quality indicators

Provide practical health suggestions based on AQI levels

This project is ideal for learning:

API integration

JSON transformation

Dashboard design

DAX logic

3️⃣ Data Source
API Provider: WeatherAPI.com

Format: JSON

Data Includes:

🌡️ Current Weather: temperature, humidity, wind speed

🌫️ Air Quality: PM2.5, CO, NO₂, PM10, SO₂, O₃

4️⃣ Features & Highlights
🔗 Live API Integration
Connected Power BI to WeatherAPI using Web API connector with dynamic URLs

Real-time data refresh enabled directly in the dashboard

🛠 Data Transformation in Power Query
Parsed nested JSON objects (e.g., current, condition, air_quality)

Cleaned and renamed columns

Structured data for visualization

📈 Interactive Weather Visuals
KPI Cards for temperature, humidity, wind

Charts to track variations (can be extended with historical data)

Slicers to switch between different cities or regions

🎨 Custom Visual Enhancements
Weather icons and text-based conditions

User-friendly and engaging layout

🌫 Air Quality Indicators (AQI) with DAX
Developed dynamic and reusable DAX measures:

Color-coded AQI indicators

AQI Status (Good, Moderate, Unhealthy, etc.)

Health Tips based on pollutant levels

♻️ Reusable & Scalable DAX Templates
Generic DAX logic for:

PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, CO, O₃

Easy to extend for new metrics or data sources

🎛 User Interactivity
Filters, slicers, and conditional formatting

Select data by city or pollutant

Real-time visual updates

🧠 Learning-Oriented Design
Perfect for Power BI beginners to intermediates:

Covers key concepts: APIs, JSON, visuals, DAX

Hands-on dashboard development
